            Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by
            newspapers and magazines?
          </p>

          <p>
            More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by
            makers of calendars, postcards, for advertisements, and for
            illustrating books, stories and articles?

                This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the
                question: "How can I make my camera-work profitable?"
              </p>

              <cite class="article-subheading">
                A. H. Beardsley, <br />
                Publisher, Photo-Era Magazine.
              </cite>
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          <p>
            At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers
            and publisher-photo-services." But professional photographers do not
            produce one-third of the photographs used, and
            publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of
            camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.
          </p>

          <p>
            No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are
            bought from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the
            average, and sometimes smaller.
          </p>

          <p>
            The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa
            in order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon
            Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="article-simpleQuote">
            <p>
              "The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be
              realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant
              corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular
              events that focus the attention of the world now and then.
              <em
                >This is a delusion. The real triumph is that of the
                photographer who utilises the material ready at hand in his own
                district, be it large or small.</em
              >"
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            And more, a person does not have to be an expert photographer in
            order to succeed at the work. Here is what one prominent writer says
            about it:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="article-simpleQuote">
            <p>
              "The requirements of the field are well within the capabilities of
              even the beginner in photography, viz.; the ability to make good
              negatives and good prints, the ability to recognise news-value,
              and a methodical plan to find the market where the prints will
              find acceptance. The man or woman who can meet these requirements
              should be fairly successful from the beginning, and will open up
              quickly new avenues of special work and profit."
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such
            is not at all necessary to the successful selling of photographs to
            publications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is the field overcrowded? <em>No.</em> If there were ten times as
            many persons engaged in the work they could all keep themselves
            busy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The field—how wide is it? Get out your map of the world. The field
            for
            <em>making</em> photographs extends from the top margin to the
            bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for
            <em>selling</em> photographs—which is more to the point—extends over
            about five thousand publications which use prints; not to speak of a
            few score of other markets.
          </p>

          <div>
            The markets may be classified briefly:
            <ol>
              <li>Newspapers</li>
              <li>Magazines</li>
              <li>Postcard-makers</li>
              <li>Calendar-makers</li>
              <li>Art-study producers</li>
              <li>Illustrations for books</li>
              <li>Illustrations for articles</li>
              <li>Prints for advertising.</li>
            </ol>
            And there are more, of more specialised branches.
          </div>

          <p>
            And how does it pay? Please note:
            <q
              >A certain magazine once paid $100 for four prints of sundials. An
              amateur, who happened to be on the spot with a kodak, made over
              $200 out of a head-on railroad-collision. A New York professional
              netted $125 from the newspaper-use of a wedding-party, of
              considerable local prominence, which was leaving the church after
              the ceremony.</q
            >
            One amateur
            <q
              >realised $300 a year for two or three years from a lucky snapshot
              of eight pet rabbits in a row.</q
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            A set of South-Pole photographs brought $3,000 from Leslie's and
            $1,000 more from the International Feature Service. These all,
            though, are very exceptional instances. The average print sells for
            about three dollars. But there is absolutely nothing in the world to
            hinder a wide-awake person with a camera from making from several
            hundred to over $3,000 a year from his prints. If he becomes a
            specialist he may earn as high as $5,000 or even more.
          </p>

          <p>
            No discrimination is made between press-photographers. The person
            wins who <b>"delivers the goods"</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, I do not mean that the instances of $200 or so for prints
            should be taken as the prices ordinarily paid. I do not maintain
            that there is a fortune awaiting the man with the camera; but I do
            say there are unlimited possibilities for salable photographs and
            almost an unlimited number of markets for them. But there are not
            "barrels of money" in it, for all. A person may add appreciably to
            his income for having sold photographs; and having developed the
            trade to a high degree, he may cash cheques to the amount of $5,000
            or more a year. But not every one. Just some. And it isn't like the
            log and the falling off it. It's work—hard work—<em>hard work</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Success at selling press-photographs does not depend on the size of
            the town you live in, the cost or manufacture of your apparatus, or
            on your literary ability. It depends on you and your worship of the
            homaged gods of success if you would sell photographs. The gift of
            these gods is the ability to make good.
